			<h1 class="about">Biography</h1>
			<p class="about">Deathbed Dichotomy was formed over the mutual understanding that there's no platform better than music for two people to discuss their vast philosophical differences and spread their idea of what it means to "believe" and "live". Luke Ganje, a writer by trade, approached Ben Jyring, a musician recently left without a band, with the intent of starting a summer project. The planning process involved many hours of heated religious and political debate, which spurred Luke to write with the passion seen in the 2013 release.</p>

			<h3 class="about">Description</h3>

			<p class="about">Deathbed Dichotomy has one simple goal: to make music and to incite intelligent conversation while doing it. Our sound has strong black metal influences, but we maintain that we will never be afraid to step outside our comfort zones, genre-jumping whenever we see fit if the music or lyrics written dictate such a move.<br>
			In 2013, they released a self-titled debut EP with three tracks, an unintentially therepeudic journey of self-discovery for both members. It was exciting for them to connect as friends, to share each other's burdens and to release them as music, and to learn the technical side of musical production. Through hours of frustration and technical difficulty, they came up with the sound you hear today.</p>
